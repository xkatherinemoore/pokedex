        <h2>JavaScript Uses</h2>
        <p>All links within this section will open in a new tab</p>
        <h3>Game Progress Summary/Homepage (<a href="index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">index.html</a>)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Show/Hide About Section:
                <p>The About Section (#about) display is toggled using buttons (#close-about & #open-about) and jQuery's .show() and .hide() methods. The div objects that are toggled are accessed using jQuery selectors, and when clicked, they will initiate the .show() and .hide() methods for the relevant divs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Load Relevant Game Data:
                <p>When the user selects one of the radio button options to choose a game version (change event), a picture is added to the #game-photo element to display the game selection. Each game version also contains different set of Pokemon to collect, and these totals are saved in relevant variables within the JavaScript file. They are displayed in the #summary-pokemon section.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Add Badges:
                <p>The user is able to add and remove gym badges by clicking within the div elements. The script to do this utilizes jQuery to select the .badge class elements, and when one is clicked, it fires an event. The event object is then used to determine which of the .badge elements was clicked (return the id of the target object). If the clicked element already contains an img element, then it is removed. If not, the correct image path is found based on the target, a new image element is created with this path as the src attribute, and it is inserted as the first child of the div.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Update Current Pokedex Table:
                <p>The user adds a Pokemon to the Current Pokedex table via a form (#add-pokemon). This form makes use of an HTML datalist to ensure that only valid entries are added. On submission, Javascript is used to retrieve the submitted value and lookup information in the pokedex array (pokedex.js). The object returned from the pokedex array contains information which is added into td elements, which are then added into a single tr element that is added to the tbody via JavaScript's .appendChild() method. Pokemon count variables are incremented (since the table indicates that a Pokemon was caught) and updated, and the last line of the submission function clears the form using the .reset() method.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Delete Table Entry:
                <p>To delete an entry on the Current Pokedex table (#current-pokedex), the user can click on the trash can button that was added in the right-most column of the table entry. Event delegation is used because the delete button does not exist when the page is initially loaded. When the user clicks within the #current-pokedex table, an event is fired. If the event.target has a class name of .delButton, then the code executes to delete the table row element. This code also decrements pokemon count variables and updates the page.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Pokedex (<a href="pokedex.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pokedex.html</a>)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Initial Table Render (js/pokedextable.js)
                <p>The table located on the pokedex.html page was initially rendered using a JavaScript function. Each table element was created by iterating through the pokedex array. After the table was rendered in a browser, the HTML code was copied and added into the HTML document. This was done for efficiency purposes (so page content wasn't relying on a script to load). However, creating the table using a script was much easier and faster than if it had all been typed out by hand. The function used to render the table can be viewed at <a href="./js/pokedextable.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">js/pokedextable.js</a>. Note that this file is no longer loaded on any page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Table Sort
                <p>Users are able to sort the table by clicking on the header they want to sort by. Users are able to sort by Pokedex number, Pokemon name, or Pokemon Type. The sortTable function iterates through the table, comparing the value from the rows. The majority of this function was taken from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sort_table.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3 Schools</a>, though their given code only allowed for alphabetical sorts. The code was updated to allow for the table to be sorted by numbers as well (switch statement). The sortTable function is called when the user clicks on a th element in the #pokedex table. jQuery was used to write this function.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Search Pokedex
                <p>A search bar (#pokedex-search) can be used to filter/search the table. The input field triggers an event onkeyup, so the table will update while the user is typing and does not require the user to submit the search input. The function makes use of jQuery's filter and toggle methods. As the user types, the input value is compared against the table rows, and if no part of the row matches the input, the display is toggled (hidden). The #clear-search icon is used to remove a previous search without having to backspace within the input field.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Update Caught? Picture
                <p>The user is able to indicate in the #pokedex table whether or not a pokemon has been caught. When they click on the PokeBall, the image will change to either grayscale or color based on the current value. This is done using jQuery and setting the img's src attribute value.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
